The problem:
youtube's model is not very friendly for hobbyists and educators


# Let's say you want to upload a video,
# an educational video about mathematics.
# And you choose to upload on Youtube,
# because, what else is there available anyways.
# 
# So you upload it.


Now, let's say a friend of yours wants to watch that video.
So he opens the link you sent, and first thing he notices
is that it's all full of advertisements.

Very distracting, very annoying


Berni: vale, que si, que los anuncios son molestos
pero que tambien son importantes para que la empresa gane dinero.
O sea, no pasa nada por ver unos segundos de anuncios
si eso hace que puedas ver el video despues, no?


Well, here comes the second problem.
The ad-based monetization is based on "the attention economy",
which means your time is money
and they'll do everything they can to
retain your attention for as long as they possibly can.

Or in other words, they will try to make you an addict
and scroll for hours a day
watching low-quality content
and making you miserable,
but only if you get hooked.

Needless to say, that's not what you want when looking for educat
