# Video service - projecte final

# [Your Project Name] - Go Video Service

[![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.x-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://golang.org/)

This project is a video service from where users can upload and play videos.

This project was developed as part of the Web Development course at ETP Xavier.

## Features

* **Cool videos!!:** El berni hace piruetas
* **Thumbnails and info:** It is indeed a very complete API.
* **Sessions and authentication:** So that we don't get anons posting <insert illegal video title here>
* **Upload and search for videos:** To interact with the api (it's interactive!!)

**Limitations:**
* This thing doesn't allow deleting or editing anything, and it could never be used in production in its current state.
* It also allows files other than videos. Again, because of the lack of time.

## Technologies Used

* **Go:** The primary programming language.
* **Gin Gonic** Super minimal and fast Go framework for basic functionality
* **Postgresql** It was meant for more advanced features, but the only remarkable utility of it is to fuzzy search. Aside from that, it's just a basic relational database.

## What about the UML diagram?
Look through the documentation,
it provides the same information that a UML diagram would.

If you still need one, this is my humble attempt at making it:
